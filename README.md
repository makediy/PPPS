# Portable programmable power supply

Portable programmable power supply (PPPS) is a compact and efficient USB power supply. which uses USB type-c as input, supports PD mode, and the output range is 1-22V. It is controlled by USB, wifi, bluetooth, and supports data recording and remote control. It has the characteristics of low cost, high efficiency and easy to use, and can be used in embedded development, DIY, automatic testing and so on.
